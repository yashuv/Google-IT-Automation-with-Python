The code is a Python script that performs data synchronization from ~/data/prod/ to ~/data/prod_backup/ using the subprocess and multiprocessing modules.

It starts by importing the necessary modules:

multiprocessing is used to create and manage a pool of processes.
subprocess is used to run external commands, in this case rsync.
os is used to manipulate file paths.
The home_path variable is set to the home directory of the current user by expanding the ~ symbol using os.path.expanduser(). The src and dest variables are set to the full path of the source and destination directories respectively, using the home_path variable.

In the if __name__ == "__main__" block, a Pool object is created with the number of worker processes equal to the number of CPU cores on the system, obtained using multiprocessing.cpu_count(). The apply() method of the Pool object is then called with the subprocess.call function and its arguments, ["rsync", "-arq", src, dest], to run the rsync command in a separate process.

The if __name__ == "__main__" block is a common pattern used to ensure the code inside the block is only executed if the script is run directly and not imported as a module.

import subprocess
import multiprocessing

def sync_data(src, dest):
    subprocess.call(["rsync", "-arq", src, dest])

def main():
    home_path = os.path.expanduser('~') 
    src = os.path.join(home_path, "data/prod/") 
    dest = os.path.join(home_path, "data/prod_backup/") 

    with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=multiprocessing.cpu_count()) as pool:
        pool.apply(sync_data, args=(src, dest,))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
